# Running Windows on the Samsung Galaxy A52s

## Troubleshooting Issues
> Below you will find a list of common problems and their solutions

## Device has a permanent black screen
> If this happens, you've most likely been sent into EDL mode, which is likely because of Windows 11 24H2.
- Not only is this easily fixed, but the fix also corrects your GPT tables, so that it will not happen again.
- To fix this issue, please use the [EDL guide](edl.md)

## Device is not recognized in fastboot or recovery
> This likely means you don't have (proper) USB drivers installed
- Download [QUD.zip](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Qfil/QUD.zip) here and extract it.
- Open Device Manager and find an unknown device or device with errors that may be called **Android**, **ADB Interface**, or **QUSB_BULK**.
- Right click this devjce, select "Update Drivers" > "Browse files", then select the **QUD folder** you extracted before.

## LTE and other network services in Android no longer work
> Sometimes Windows may wipe your modem partitions, resulting in the loss of LTE in Android. To fix this, you'll need to restore your modem using the backups that you hopefully made [while partitioning your device](1-partition.md#backing-up-important-files). If you did not do this step, there is likely no way to recover.
- Boot into any recovery other than the stock recovery (ADB commands do not work there)
- Open CMD in the **platform-tools** folder.
- Restore the four partitions that you backed up using the below commands. Replace `path\to` with the actual path of the images.
```cmd
adb push path\to\fsc.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/fsc.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/fsc
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\fsg.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/fsg.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/fsg
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\modemst1.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/modemst1.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/modemst1
```

```cmd
adb push path\to\modemst2.bin /cache/ & adb shell dd if=/cache/modemst2.bin of=/dev/block/by-name/modemst2
```
- Reboot your device and check if LTE works.

## Cannot mount Windows in Android
If mounting Windows produces an empty folder, you either don't have Windows installed, or your rom does not have mount support.

Solution: Try changing your ROM.

##### Finished!

## Cannot write to Windows in Android
> This is caused by shutting down Windows instead of restarting it.
>
> Sometimes it's also a ROM issue.
- To solve this, boot to Windows and then press "restart", then as the screen shuts off boot to TWRP and from there load up Android.
- Or, disable hibernation in Windows. 
> Alternatively, if you have already set up the Switch to Android app, simply use this to switch to Android.

##### Finished!

## Error: 3 The system cannot find the path specified.
This error usually means that you are trying to install Windows on a disk that already has Windows installed. To solve this issue, format the disk in Windows Explorer and try again.

##### Finished!

## 0xc000021a BSOD
This usually means that winlogon.exe has failed, and you may need to reapply the Windows image.

##### Finished!

## The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error
If you stumble upon this error, you will need to [reinstall Windows](reinstall.md).

##### Finished!

## INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD
This Blue Screen of Death likely means some broken driver installation. To fix this, [reinstall Windows](reinstall.md).
