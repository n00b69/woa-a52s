# Running Windows on the Samsung Galaxy A52s

## Updating drivers without a PC

### Prerequisites
- A Galaxy A52s with Windows already installed

- [A52s WinInstaller](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-a52s/releases/download/Files/A52sWinInstaller_v6.9.zip)

- TWRP or any other recovery with decryption support

### Notes
> [!WARNING]  
> 
> DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/a52sxq_uefi).

> [!Important]
> This guide assumes you have already installed Windows. If you haven't, use the [installation guide](nopc.md) instead.

### Preparing necessary files
- Download **A52sWinInstaller.zip** and keep it in your internal storage.

### Reboot into TWRP
> If you don't have TWRP installed, flash it again using [these instructions](nopc.md#flash-the-modified-twrp)
- In the main menu of **Magisk**, press the rotating arrow icon in the top right, and press `Reboot Recovery`.

### Flashing WinInstaller
- In TWRP, select **Install** and then locate **A52sWinInstaller.zip** and flash it.
- Once you're given the option to reboot, do so.
> [!Note]
> Wait untill all processes complete and your device boots back into Windows. This will take around 20-30 minutes.

## Finished!
